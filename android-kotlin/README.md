- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) Ladybug or newer

## Permissions (already configured)

- <https://docs.ditto.live/install-guides/kotlin/android-permissions>

## Documentation

- [Kotlin Install Guide](https://docs.ditto.live/install-guides/kotlin)
- [Kotlin API Reference](https://software.ditto.live/android/Ditto/4.11.1/api-reference/)

## Building and Running the Android Application

Assuming you have Android Studio and other prerequisites installed, you can
build and run the app by following these steps:

1. Create an application at <https://portal.ditto.live/>.  Make note of the app ID and online playground token.
2. Copy the `.env.sample` file at the top level of the `quickstart` repo to `.env` and add your App ID, Online Playground Token, Auth URL, and Websocket URL.
3. Launch Android Studio and open the `quickstart/android-kotlin` directory.
4. In Android Studio, select a connected Android device, or create and launch an Android emulator and select it as the destination, then choose the **Run > Run 'app'** menu item.

The app will build and run on the selected device or emulator.  You can add,
edit, and delete tasks in the app.

If you run the app on additional devices or emulators, the data will be synced
between them.

Compatible with Android Automotive OS (AAOS)

## A Guided Tour of the Android App Source Code

The Android app is a simple to-do list app that demonstrates how to use the
Ditto Android SDK to sync data with other devices.
It is implemented using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/compose), which is a modern toolkit for building native Android UI.

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with Android development and with Compose, but needs some guidance on how to use Ditto.  The following is a summary of the key parts of integration with Ditto.

### Adding the Ditto SDK

At the bottom of `app/build.gradle.kts`, you will see this line that causes Android Studio to automatically download the Ditto SDK from Maven Central and add it to the project:

```kotlin
    implementation("live.ditto:ditto:4.11.1")
```

To use a newer version of the SDK, change the version number in this line.

### Initializing Ditto

The Ditto initialization process uses dependency injection with Koin and follows a clean architecture pattern:

#### Application Setup
In `app/src/main/java/live/ditto/quickstart/tasks/TasksApplication.kt`, the `TasksApplication` class extends `Application` and serves as the entry point for the app. In its `onCreate()` method, it:

1. **Starts Koin Dependency Injection**: Initializes the Koin framework for dependency injection
2. **Registers Dependencies**: Sets up all the app's dependencies including Ditto configuration

#### Configuration Management
The app reads Ditto configuration from BuildConfig fields that are populated from the `.env` file during build time:
- `BuildConfig.DITTO_APP_ID` - Your Ditto application ID
- `BuildConfig.DITTO_PLAYGROUND_TOKEN` - Your online playground authentication token  
- `BuildConfig.DITTO_AUTH_URL` - The Ditto Auth URL
- `BuildConfig.DITTO_WEBSOCKET_URL` - The Ditto Websocket URL

These values are wrapped in a `DittoConfig` object and injected throughout the app.

#### DittoManager Implementation
In `app/src/main/java/live/ditto/quickstart/tasks/data/DittoManager.kt`, the `DittoManager` class handles all Ditto operations:

1. **Initialization**: Creates a Ditto instance using `DittoIdentity.OnlinePlayground` with the provided configuration
2. **Transport Configuration**: Sets up websocket URLs and disables v3 peer sync for DQL compatibility
3. **Database Setup**: Disables DQL strict mode to allow flexible queries
4. **Data Operations**: Provides methods for CRUD operations on tasks using DQL queries

#### Dependency Injection
The app uses Koin for dependency injection, where:
- `DittoConfig` is provided as a singleton with the configuration values
- `DittoManager` is provided as the `DataManager` implementation
- ViewModels receive the `DittoManager` instance through constructor injection
- `ErrorService` handles error display throughout the app

This architecture ensures that Ditto is properly initialized once when the app starts and is available throughout the app lifecycle via dependency injection.

### The Task Data Model

The task data model is implemented as a Kotlin data class in
`app/src/main/java/live/ditto/quickstart/tasks/data/TaskModel.kt`.  This class has
properties `_id`, `title`, `done`, and `deleted`.  The `_id` property is a unique identifier for the task, and the `deleted` property is used to mark tasks that have been deleted but are still present in the store.

This class has a `fromJson()` method that can be used to convert the JSON data returned by the Ditto store into a `TaskModel` object, which can then be used by Kotlin code.

### The Tasks List

The main screen is a list of all tasks.  This is implemented in
`app/src/main/java/live/ditto/quickstart/tasks/list/TasksListScreen.kt`.  The
associated view model is in
`app/src/main/java/live/ditto/quickstart/tasks/list/TasksListScreenViewModel.kt`,
which is where all the code is for retrieving data from the Ditto store and
converting it into objects that can be displayed onscreen.

### The Edit Screen

The edit screen allows the user to enter a new task or to edit an existing task.
It is implemented in
`app/src/main/java/live/ditto/quickstart/tasks/list/edit/EditScreen.kt`.  The
associated view model is in
`app/src/main/java/live/ditto/quickstart/tasks/list/edit/EditScreenViewModel.kt`,
and this contains the associated code for manipulating data in the Ditto store.
